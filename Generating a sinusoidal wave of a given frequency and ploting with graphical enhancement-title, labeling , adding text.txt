EXPERIMENT NO 8 :- Generating a sinusoidal wave of a given frequency and ploting with graphical enhancement-title, labeling , adding text. 


BasebandFrequency = 10e3;
SamplingFrequency = 1e6;
BufferLength = 200;
n = 0:(BufferLength - 1);
BasebandSignal = sin(2*%pi*n / (SamplingFrequency/BasebandFrequency));
